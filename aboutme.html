<h1> About Me </h1>
<br/>
<p> My name is Sophia Wang, and I am a high school girl living in New York City. I am a nature lover and foodie.
  <br/>
  My hobbies include snowboarding, photography, playing the guitar, and swimming. I am currently exploring
  <br/>
  the computer science field through the program Girls Who Code. I love to try new things but I am very impatient.
  <br/>
  A fun fact about me is that I am a vocal major in the high school Fiorello H. Laguardia.
